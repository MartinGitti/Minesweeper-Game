This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### How to install Minesweeper game to play on local machine:

1st step: Ensure that node.js is installed on your pc. Use the following link to install node.js => [link to Google!](https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.18.1/node-v12.18.1-x64.msi)

### Rules of Minesweeper:

Click on various tiles in order to display what the tile holds.

Beware though not to click on a tile that holds a mine because that will be the end of the round.

Use the the indicating numbers of all the surrounding mines neighboring the tile clicked upon.

Tip: Each tile has only eight tiles that surround it.

There are 10 flags available to place in the positions where mines are suspected to be, by using the right-click mouse button.

You are also able to claim a flag back by right-clicking on a tile that already has a flag.

If you happen to click on a tile that hold a hidden mine, the round will end. You can carry on playing by clicking on the emoji face that will reset the board, allow you to play a new round of minesweeper.
            
Open all the tiles that don't have a mine in order to win the round. Don't worry, you will get the hang of the game rather quickly. Be smart, be calm and sweep past all the mines.

### Goal of Minesweeper Game:

Work your way around the board, avoiding any hidden mines with use of the indicating number of nearby mines that the tiles displays when clicked, this will give you an idea of which tiles to avoid.

The mines are dispersed randomly accross the board with each round. 
        
If you suspect a tile to hold a mine, make use of the flags by right-clicking on a tile.

If you manage to open all the tiles that do not hold a mine, you win the round!
